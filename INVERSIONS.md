# Architectural Inversions

`duckduckgo-search-cli` deliberately inverts several common Rust ecosystem
defaults. This document explains each inversion, why it was made, and what
the trade-off is. Read this before proposing a "standard" alternative in
PRs — every inversion here has a recorded rationale that a "more idiomatic"
choice would silently break.

## Inversion 1 — `wreq` instead of `reqwest` (v0.7.3–v0.8.5, REVERSED in v0.8.6)

> **Status: REVERSED in v0.8.6** — replaced by `reqwest` + `rustls-tls` (ADR-0008). Chrome headed (v0.8.0+) provides real browser TLS fingerprint, making BoringSSL emulation redundant. The BoringSSL build toolchain (NASM, CMake, Perl) blocked Windows users from `cargo install`.

- **Default expectation**: new Rust CLI projects use `reqwest` with `rustls-tls`.
- **What we did (v0.7.3)**: replaced `reqwest 0.12 + rustls` with `wreq 6.0.0-rc.29`
  (statically links BoringSSL).
- **Why**: `rustls` produces a canonical TLS fingerprint that Cloudflare Bot
  Management recognizes as non-browser, triggering CAPTCHA interstitials on
  DuckDuckGo. `wreq` + BoringSSL produces a fingerprint identical to Chrome
  and Safari, eliminating the CAPTCHA on macOS. See `docs/decisions/0001-tls-boring-via-wreq.md`.
- **Trade-off**: `wreq 6.0.0-rc` is a release candidate (not stable 1.0);
  compile time is ~40s longer due to BoringSSL; builds require `cmake`,
  `perl`, `pkg-config`, `libclang-dev` on Linux and NASM/CMake/MSVC/Perl on
  Windows. Every `cargo install` compiles BoringSSL from source.
- **Why reversed (v0.8.6)**: Chrome headed (primary transport since v0.8.0) generates a REAL browser TLS fingerprint, making wreq/BoringSSL emulation redundant. The BoringSSL build toolchain (NASM, CMake, Perl, MSVC) was a total barrier for Windows users (GAP-WS-066). See `docs/decisions/0008-reqwest-rustls-v0-8-6.md`.

## Inversion 2 — Thiserror for libs, no anyhow in library code (v0.5.0+)

- **Default expectation**: `anyhow::Result` is the de-facto standard for
  application-level Rust code.
- **What we did**: defined `enum CliError` (15 variants) in `src/error.rs`
  via `thiserror`. Every error has a typed `error_code()` and `exit_code()`.
  No `anyhow` in `src/`.
- **Why**: machine-readable exit codes (0..=6) and error codes
  (`http_error`, `rate_limited`, etc.) are part of the public contract.
  `anyhow` would erase these. AI agents and CI scripts branch on
  `error_code` to decide retry vs. fail.
- **Trade-off**: 15 variant match arms on every `?`. New error types
  require updating `exit_code()` and `error_code()`. Mitigation:
  the `error.rs` `#[non_exhaustive]` attribute on `CliError` allows
  downstream consumers to be forward-compatible.
- **No-go for revert**: removing typed errors would silently break every
  agent that matches on `error_code` for retry logic.

## Inversion 3 — `BTreeMap` for histogram in multi-query output (v0.8.0+)

- **Default expectation**: `HashMap` for aggregation.
- **What we did**: `MultiSearchOutput.causa_zero_histogram: BTreeMap<String, u32>`.
- **Why**: deterministic iteration order across runs is required for
  golden-file snapshot tests and for reproducible JSON output
  (`insta = "1"` snapshot tests). `HashMap` introduces random
  iteration order → flaky snapshot tests.
- **Trade-off**: slightly slower insert (O(log n) vs O(1)). Histogram
  has <100 entries in practice; cost is negligible.
- **No-go for revert**: a non-deterministic JSON output breaks the
  snapshot test contract.

## Inversion 4 — Portuguese Brazilian field names in JSON output (v0.2.0+)

- **Default expectation**: Rust ecosystem uses English identifiers.
- **What we did**: `SearchResult` fields serialize as `posicao`, `titulo`,
  `url`, `url_exibicao`, `snippet`, etc. (not `position`, `title`, `url`).
- **Why**: README examples and `jaq` recipes in `docs/COOKBOOK.md` use
  Portuguese queries; English fields broke those pipelines (bug reported
  by user in v0.1.0 → fixed in v0.2.0). The PT-BR naming is a
  load-bearing part of the agent's mental model.
- **Trade-off**: pipelines from other ecosystems (`n8n`, `zapier`,
  `make.com`) need to learn the Portuguese field names. The
  `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md` documents the full mapping table.
- **No-go for revert**: changing field names would silently break every
  CI pipeline built on the v0.2.0+ contract. The v0.1.0 → v0.2.0
  migration guide was a one-time event.

## Inversion 5 — `#[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]` for ALL Option fields

- **Default expectation**: serialize `Option::None` as JSON `null`.
- **What we did**: every `Option<T>` field in `types.rs` carries
  `#[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]`.
- **Why**: the JSON envelope should be minimal — consumers don't
  need to differentiate "field absent" from "field is null". Absent
  fields mean "not applicable for this query" (e.g., `causa_zero`
  is absent when results > 0, present when zero).
- **Trade-off**: pipelines can't distinguish "field missing" from
  "field was null at serialization". Mitigation: the SKILL.md documents
  the field semantics; `causa_zero` field is an additive diagnostic
  (BC opt-out preserves the field even when exit code is 5 legacy).
- **No-go for revert**: turning on `null` serialization would
  double the size of every JSON output and require every consumer
  to handle both `null` and missing.

## Inversion 6 — `--allow-lite-fallback` as OPT-IN (v0.7.8+)

- **Default expectation**: fallback to lite endpoint when html fails.
- **What we did**: fallback requires explicit `--allow-lite-fallback`
  flag. Without it, anti-bot detection returns exit 3 with
  `cascata_motivo` populated in JSON, NOT silent fallback.
- **Why**: silent fallback violates user intent. The user may want to
  know they're being blocked (for rate limit purposes) rather than
  receive truncated results from a degraded endpoint. v0.7.8 GAP-WS-52
  fixed the silent fallback behavior.
- **Trade-off**: users who relied on the old silent behavior need to
  add the flag explicitly. The `CHANGELOG.md` Migration Guide documents
  this.
- **No-go for revert**: silent fallback was a covert behavior channel
  that surprised integrators expecting explicit opt-in.

## Inversion 7 — `bin/safety-contracts` binary for CI gates (v0.7.10+)

- **Default expectation**: a single CI workflow runs all checks.
- **What we did**: each CI gate is a discrete `bin/` script invoked
  individually by the workflow. Examples: `bin/check-fmt`, `bin/check-clippy`,
  `bin/check-tests`, `bin/check-audit`, `bin/check-coverage`, `bin/check-version-drift`.
- **Why**: discrete binaries let developers run the exact CI gate
  locally before pushing. A single `ci.yml` workflow with embedded
  bash was untestable in isolation.
- **Trade-off**: 9+ binaries to maintain. Mitigation: each binary
  is <50 lines and has a `README.md` per script.
- **No-go for revert**: monolithic CI is a known pain point for
  flake-debugging.

## Inversion 8 — `atomwrite` as the only file editing tool (v0.8.0+)

- **Default expectation**: `std::fs::write` or `tokio::fs::write` in
  Rust code, `sed -i`/`echo >` in scripts.
- **What we did**: every file modification goes through the
  `atomwrite` CLI tool with `--expect-checksum` (optimistic locking
  via BLAKE3) and atomic write (tempfile + fsync + rename).
- **Why**: a `c24-framework34.html` truncation incident (2026-06-15)
  in the upstream project lost ~127 lines of work. `atomwrite`
  provides 6 layers of defense (L1 telemetry, L2 `--require-backup`,
  L3 `--confirm`, L4 `--preview`, L5 `--auto-rotate`, L6 `risk_assessment`
  in the envelope). See ADR-0035.
- **Trade-off**: every script invocation has a `CS=$(atomwrite read --json ...)` ceremony. Mitigation: aliases in `.cargo/config.toml`
  (`cargo check-all`, `cargo lint`, etc.) reduce the boilerplate.
- **No-go for revert**: silent overwrites are exactly the failure mode
  that caused the 2026-06-15 incident.

## Inversion 9 — No telemetry, no analytics, no OTLP export (all versions)

- **Default expectation**: production CLIs emit usage telemetry
  to vendor-controlled endpoints.
- **What we did**: zero telemetry. `tracing` is used for local logs
  but never exported. `opentelemetry`, `OTLP`, `exporter`, and
  `analytics` patterns are explicitly absent from the codebase.
  CI gate `rg -n 'opentelemetry|OTLP|exporter|tracing::span' src/` returns 0.
- **Why**: privacy-first. The user is the sole owner of their search
  data. Anti-bot detection is harder when the client fingerprint
  doesn't include a telemetry agent signature.
- **Trade-off**: no observability into production usage. Mitigation:
  local `tracing` logs to stderr; `--verbose`/`-vv`/`-vvv` flags
  escalate verbosity; the user can grep their own logs.
- **No-go for revert**: the project README and SKILL.md explicitly
  state "no telemetry". Adding telemetry would require a new major
  version.

## How to Propose a New Inversion

1. Open an issue with the "Inversion Proposal" label.
2. Document: what default you're inverting, why the default fails in
   this project's context, what the trade-off is, and a no-go
   criterion (when this inversion should NOT be reverted).
3. Add a section to this file following the format of the existing
   inversions.
4. Update the `Cargo.toml` workspace `description` if the inversion
   affects the public contract.
5. Reference the inversion in the relevant ADR.
